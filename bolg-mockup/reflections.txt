Your response goes here!

*I learned some new html5 tags. I learned relationship between tags (content tree structure). Clearly understood the differences from relative and absolute paths.

*Some tage, like <p> or <span> <h1> were easy for me.

*I had difficult with relative path, because the exersice was not specifing that the image must be on the same level of the index.html. 
I put it into image folders so the exercise was not correct even tought i was using the image put as relative put (src="image/redwoods_state_park.jpg")

*Yes, i have used the problem solving: asking expert, searching on google
